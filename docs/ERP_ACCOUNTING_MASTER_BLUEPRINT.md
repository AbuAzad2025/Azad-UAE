## 2. Core Approved Accounting Principles

### 2.1 Perpetual Inventory System
The system operates on a Perpetual Inventory model. Every inventory-affecting movement (purchase, sale, return, transfer, adjustment) must trigger immediate physical stock updates and generate a balanced double-entry journal entry to the General Ledger.

### 2.2 Costing Method: Moving Weighted Average Cost (MWAC)
The sole inventory costing method is **Moving Weighted Average Cost (MWAC)**.
*   **Valuation Integrity:** No Last Purchase Cost fallback. No FIFO layers or layer consumption logic. No hybrid costing.
*   **Audit-Only History:** Product cost history is read-only for audit trails, never used by the transaction engine.
*   **Recalculation Scope:** Evaluated per product per warehouse (Approved Choice DM-02). Outgoing movements do not affect average unit costs.

### 2.3 Warehouse Transfer Costing
Transfers between warehouses are valued at the source warehouse's MWAC at the exact moment of transfer. Recipients recalculate average cost on receipt. No profit or loss is recognized on transfers.

### 2.4 Sales Returns Costing
*   **Linked Returns:** Use the original `SaleLine.cost_price` to reverse COGS.
*   **Unlinked Returns:** Use the current warehouse MWAC, with optional manual overrides and audit trails.

### 2.5 Landed Cost Capitalization
Landed costs (freight, customs, insurance, clearance, handling) are capitalized into inventory value. The default allocation method is **By Value**. Future methods will include allocation by quantity, weight, and volume.

---

## 3. Approved Decision Matrix (DM-01 to DM-14)

| ID | Decision Area | Approved Policy | Rationale |
|----|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **DM-01** | Costing Method | MWAC | Smooths volatility; standard in SAP B1 & Bisan. |
| **DM-02** | MWAC Scope | Per Product, Per Warehouse | Localized logistics tracking. |
| **DM-03** | Transfer Cost | Source warehouse MWAC | Net neutrality across stock assets. |
| **DM-04** | Linked Returns | Original SaleLine cost | Margin and COGS reversal consistency. |
| **DM-05** | Unlinked Returns | Current MWAC (manual override) | Exceptions tracking with audit trail. |
| **DM-06** | Landed Cost Alloc | Proportional By Value | Proportional allocation for mixed goods. |
| **DM-07** | Landed Cost Treatment | Capitalize into inventory | Standard IAS 2 compliance. |
| **DM-08** | Exchange Rate | Manager manual rate / Fallback online | Rate is locked on post; historical immutability. |
| **DM-09** | FX Differences | Post to FX Gain/Loss (P&L) | IAS 21 compliance. |
| **DM-10** | Closed Periods | Block all modifications | Ledger integrity. Corrections in open periods. |
| **DM-11** | Reconciliation | Reporting and monitoring only | No auto-posting without validation. |
| **DM-12** | Dynamic GL Mapping | Resolution via GL Concepts | Tenant-level mappings (Phase 1). Branch overrides (Phase 2). |
| **DM-13** | Precision Rules | Hybrid Framework | Intermediates and rates at 6 decimals; unit cost at 4; quantity at 3. |
| **DM-14** | Localization | Global Localization Framework | Country specific tax, currencies, and e-invoicing layers. |

---

## 4. Financial Dimensions & Account Structure

To prevent chart of accounts bloat (tree explosion), the system strictly decouples the financial classification of transactions from their business segment context.

### 4.1 Account Structure Principle
*   **Accounts** represent the financial nature of a balance (e.g. `SALES_REVENUE`, `INVENTORY_ASSET`).
*   **Dimensions** represent the branch, project, or location details (e.g. `branch_id = Ramallah`).
*   *Rule:* No duplicate accounts (e.g. do not create `Sales_Ramallah`).

### 4.2 Financial Dimensions Registry
Every journal line validates and records:
1.  `tenant_id`: strict tenant isolation.
2.  `branch_id`: branch classification.
3.  `warehouse_id`: warehouse context.
4.  `cost_center_id`: expense centers (e.g. department, project).
5.  `profit_center_id`: revenue-producing units.
6.  `partner_id`: customer/supplier identifier.
7.  `currency`: local or foreign currency.
8.  `payment_channel`: cash drawer cashier or bank account.

---

## 5. Multi-Country Localization Strategy (DM-14)
The **Global Localization Framework** provides hot-swappable regulatory engines:
*   **Palestine (PMA compliance):** Multi-currency ledger (ILS, JOD, USD) with 16% VAT.
*   **GCC (KSA/UAE compliance):** Native VAT calculations (5% to 15%) and WPS export support.
*   **Future Markets:** Dynamic API connectors for daily currency exchange rates and e-invoicing portals.

---

## 6. Precision Rules Framework (DM-13)
The system operates a hybrid precision model to prevent rounding drift:
*   **Quantity Precision:** 3 decimals (`Decimal('0.001')`).
*   **Unit Cost Precision:** 4 decimals (`Decimal('0.0001')`).
*   **MWAC Stored Precision:** 6 decimals (`Decimal('0.000001')`).
*   **Exchange Rate Precision:** 6 decimals (`Decimal('0.000001')`).
*   **Internal Calculations:** 6 decimals minimum.
*   **Final Journal Amounts:** Rounded to currency-specific decimals using Banker's Rounding (`ROUND_HALF_EVEN`) to guarantee debit-credit equality.

---

## 7. Operational Models & Transaction Flows

### 7.1 Model: `ProductWarehouseCost`
Represents the authoritative stock quantity and MWAC state:
*   `tenant_id` (Integer)
*   `product_id` (Integer, RESTRICT fk)
*   `warehouse_id` (Integer, index)
*   `quantity` (Numeric 15, 3)
*   `average_cost` (Numeric 15, 6)

### 7.2 Model: `ProductCostHistory`
Audit-only historical cost recalculation trace. Never used to consume cost layers.

### 7.3 General Ledger Concept Registry
This section is the authoritative approved GL Concept Registry for active implementation. Transactions resolve ledger codes dynamically using the following standard concepts:
*   `AR`, `AP`, `CASH`, `BANK`
*   `INVENTORY_ASSET`, `COGS`, `COGS_REVERSAL`
*   `SALES_REVENUE`, `SALES_RETURNS`, `SALES_DISCOUNT`
*   `VAT_INPUT`, `VAT_OUTPUT`
*   `FX_GAIN`, `FX_LOSS`
*   `CHEQUES_UNDER_COLLECTION`
*   `INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT_GAIN`, `INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT_LOSS`
*   `FREIGHT_IN`, `CUSTOMS_DUTY`
*   `DEFERRED_CHEQUES_PAYABLE`, `PARTNER_CURRENT_ACCOUNT`, `MERCHANT_CURRENT_ACCOUNT`
*   `SHIPPING_REVENUE`, `DONATION_REVENUE`, `BANK_INTEREST_INCOME`
*   `MISC_EXPENSE`, `COMMISSION_EXPENSE`, `BANK_FEES`
*   `EMPLOYEE_ADVANCES`, `PAYROLL_EXPENSE`, `PAYROLL_PAYABLE`
*   `FIXED_ASSET_ASSET`, `DEPRECIATION_EXPENSE`, `ACCUMULATED_DEPRECIATION`
*   `FIXED_ASSET_GAIN`, `FIXED_ASSET_LOSS`

Numeric values such as `1130`, `1140`, `2110`, `4100`, and `5100` are legacy GL account codes, not concept codes. Header/group accounts such as `2000`, `2100`, `4000`, and `5000` are not required posting concepts and must not be used for transaction posting mappings unless explicitly approved by Finance Architecture. The active Phase 1E implementation must follow this final concept registry rather than older discovery rows.

---

## 8. Posting Rules Engine Examples

### 8.1 Cash Sale
*   **Debit:** `CASH` (Sales net + VAT)
*   **Credit:** `SALES_REVENUE` (Sales net)
*   **Credit:** `VAT_OUTPUT` (VAT amount)
*   **Debit:** `COGS` (MWAC cost)
*   **Credit:** `INVENTORY_ASSET` (MWAC cost)

### 8.2 Inventory Purchase (Credit)
*   **Debit:** `INVENTORY_ASSET` (Cost + Landed Cost)
*   **Debit:** `VAT_INPUT` (Recoverable VAT)
*   **Credit:** `AP` (Total vendor payable)

### 8.3 Post-Dated Cheque Collection
*   **Debit:** `CHEQUES_UNDER_COLLECTION` (Cheque value)
*   **Credit:** `AR` (Customer credit reduction)

---

## 9. Treasury & Cash Management
The treasury module supports:
*   **Multiple Cash Boxes:** Tracked per cashier per branch.
*   **Multiple Bank Accounts:** Centrally managed, assigned to branches.
*   **Employee Advances:** Tracked in dedicated employee sub-ledger accounts, cleared upon payroll runs.
*   **Cash Positioning:** Real-time cash position reporting aggregates cash boxes, bank accounts, and cheques under collection.

---

## 10. Cost Centers & Profit Centers
*   **Profit Center:** Tracks revenue and COGS by `branch_id` or product line.
*   **Cost Center:** Tracks departmental overheads (e.g. HR, Fleet Maintenance) against budgets.
*   *Reporting:* Evaluated via line-item dimensional queries.

---

## 11. Reconciliation Strategy
Reconciliation compares physical stock levels (stock movements), system inventory valuations (`ProductWarehouseCost`), and General Ledger accounts. It is strictly **read-only** and generates discrepancy reports for manual resolution. It does not automatically write correcting entries.

## 12. Implementation History & Completed Work

This section records all hardening batches and modernization phases that have been completed, with verification evidence and migration references.

---

### 12.1 Batch 1: Tenant Isolation (Advanced Accounting)
**Goal:** Add `tenant_id` scoping to `CustomsTax`, `AdvancedExpense`, and `TaxCalculationRule`.

- [x] Modified `models/advanced_accounting.py` with `tenant_id` and relationships.
- [x] Created Alembic migration `add_tenant_scoping_advanced_accounting`.
- [x] Implemented intelligent inference backfill (Branch → GL → User).
- [x] Added validation phase to abort migration if rows remain unmapped.
- [x] Applied `NOT NULL` and `UniqueConstraint` updates.
- [x] Verified isolation via static analysis.

**Status:** COMPLETED (v2). Inference chains, schema verification, logic simulation, and safety all validated.

---

### 12.2 Batch 2: Audit Trail Protection (RESTRICT on Stock Movements)
**Goal:** Prevent accidental deletion of inventory history by switching from `CASCADE` to `RESTRICT`.

- [x] Modified `models/product.py` to remove ORM-level cascade on `stock_movements`.
- [x] Modified `models/warehouse.py` to change `ondelete='CASCADE'` to `ondelete='RESTRICT'`.
- [x] Created Alembic migration `audit_trail_001_restrict_stock_movements`.
- [x] Verified constraint names match initial schema.

**Status:** COMPLETED.

---

### 12.3 Batch 3: Financial Relationship Safety
**Goal:** Protect financial audit history by removing unsafe ORM-level `cascade='all, delete-orphan'` and enforcing `ON DELETE RESTRICT` at PostgreSQL level.

| Parent | Child | Risk Fixed |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `Sale` | `SaleLine` | Deleting a sale would silently wipe all line items |
| `Purchase` | `PurchaseLine` | Deleting a purchase would silently wipe all line items |
| `GLJournalEntry` | `GLJournalLine` | Deleting a journal entry would erase the double-entry record |

- [x] Removed `cascade='all, delete-orphan'` from `Sale.lines`, `Purchase.lines`, `GLJournalEntry.lines`
- [x] Changed FKs to `db.ForeignKey(..., ondelete='RESTRICT')`
- [x] Created migration `batch_3_001_financial_relationship_safety.py`
- [x] PostgreSQL constraint inspection confirms `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on all 3 FKs
- [x] App loads correctly after changes

**Status:** COMPLETED.

---

### 12.4 Batch 4: Indexing & Schema Hardening
**Goal:** Add missing secondary indexes on high-traffic Foreign Key join columns.

**Methodology:** Queried `information_schema.table_constraints` vs `pg_index` to find FK columns lacking index support.

| # | Table | Column | References | Query Impact |
|---|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | `sales` | `seller_id` | `users.id` | Sales-by-seller reports, commission |
| 2 | `purchases` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Purchase audit trails |
| 3 | `payments` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Payment audit trails |
| 4 | `receipts` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Receipt audit trails |
| 5 | `expenses` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Expense approval workflows |
| 6 | `cheques` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Cheque issuance tracking |
| 7 | `stock_movements` | `user_id` | `users.id` | Inventory movement audit |
| 8 | `gl_journal_lines` | `cost_center_id` | `cost_centers.id` | Cost center reporting |
| 9 | `product_returns` | `customer_id` | `customers.id` | Customer return history |
| 10 | `product_returns` | `processed_by` | `users.id` | Return processing audit |

- [x] Added `index=True` to all 10 columns in their respective models
- [x] Created migration `batch_4_001_add_missing_fk_indexes.py`
- [x] PostgreSQL verification confirms all 10 indexes exist
- [x] Zero data changes

**Status:** COMPLETED.

---

### 12.5 Batch 5: Model/Migration Sync
**Goal:** Identify and fix nullability mismatches between SQLAlchemy model definitions and the physical PostgreSQL schema.

**Methodology:** Automated scan compared `column.nullable` on every mapped model against `information_schema.columns.is_nullable`.

| Table | Column | Model | Database (Before) | NULL Rows | Action |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| `cheques` | `tenant_id` | `nullable=False` | `YES` | 0 | ALTER COLUMN NOT NULL |
| `partners` | `is_active` | `nullable=False` | `YES` | 0 | ALTER COLUMN NOT NULL |

- [x] Created migration `batch_5_001_fix_nullability_mismatches.py`
- [x] Zero backfill required (0 NULL rows in both columns)
- [x] PostgreSQL verification confirms both columns now `NO`
- [x] Migration graph merged: `audit_trail_001` + `batch_5_001` → `merge_batch5_audit_heads_001`

**Status:** COMPLETED.

---

### 12.6 Phase 1: Dynamic GL Mapping — All Sub-Phases Completed

| Sub-Phase | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **1E** | `GLAccountMapping` model, concept registry, migration, feature flag | ✅ COMPLETED | Migration `gl_mapping_001`; `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL_MAPPING` defaults `False` |
| **1F** | Read-only GL mapping validation / dry-run tool | ✅ COMPLETED | `tools/qa/gl_mapping_validation_dry_run.py` reports readiness per tenant |
| **1G** | Safe seed preview (`--preview-seed`) | ✅ COMPLETED | Proposes candidates; no inserts/updates/deletes |
| **1G.1** | Candidate discovery (`--discover-candidates`) | ✅ COMPLETED | 72 combinations checked; 41 safe candidates found |

| **1L** | Controlled Transaction-Flow QA | ✅ COMPLETED | All 9 core flows exercised with flag temporarily enabled; balanced entries verified; test records cleaned |

**Discovery Results (from Phase 1G.1):**
- 72 total concept-tenant combinations (12 concepts × 6 tenants)
- 41 safe single-candidate mappings discovered
- 13 rows require owner selection (multiple valid candidates)
- 25 rows require manual GL account creation
- Concepts unresolvable from existing accounts: `CUSTOMS_DUTY`, `FREIGHT_IN`, `INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT_GAIN`, `SALES_RETURNS` (all tenants); `CASH` (1 tenant)

---

### 12.7 Currency Dynamic GL Mapping Fix (June 5, 2026)
**Goal:** Fix 12 currency-related issues identified in audit report. Make GL currency tenant-aware and add original amount tracking.

| # | File | Fix |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | `utils/helpers.py` | `format_currency_display` falls back to `Tenant.default_currency` before `SystemSettings` |
| 2 | `models/gl.py` | Added `amount` column to `GLJournalLine` (original currency net amount) |
| 3 | `models/gl.py` | `reverse_entry()` preserves `amount` in reversed lines |
| 4 | `services/gl_service.py` | `create_journal_entry()` accepts `currency` and `exchange_rate` params, resolves from tenant |
| 5 | `services/gl_service.py` | `GLJournalLine` stores `amount=original_debit - original_credit` alongside `amount_aed` |
| 6 | `services/gl_service.py` | `post_entry()` passes `currency` and `rate` to `create_journal_entry` |
| 7 | `services/gl_service.py` | `create_manual_entry()` stores `amount` on each line |
| 8 | `services/gl_posting.py` | `post_or_fail()` defaults currency from `Tenant.default_currency` instead of hardcoded `AED` |
| 9 | `services/gl_tree_builder.py` | Existing accounts: **preserved** their currency (no longer forced to AED) |
| 10 | `services/gl_tree_builder.py` | New accounts created with tenant's `default_currency` |
| 11 | `services/gl_tree_builder.py` | Liquidity accounts created with tenant's `default_currency` |
| 12 | `utils/system_init.py` | Core GL accounts seeded with first active tenant's `default_currency` |

**Migration:** `currency_audit_001_add_amount_to_gl_journal_lines.py`
- Adds `amount` column to `gl_journal_lines`
- Backfills existing rows from `amount_aed` (historical data was all AED)

**Additional fix:** `ILS` (Israeli Shekel) added to `CURRENCIES` in `utils/constants.py`.

**Status:** COMPLETED, committed `8d81f47`, pushed to `origin/main`.

---

### 12.8 Phase 2-8 Schema Foundation & Feature Flags (June 5, 2026)
**Goal:** Complete all partially implemented schema foundations identified in the Code and System Verification Report. Bring every "partially completed" item to "fully completed" at the schema/model level.

| Area | Action | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Phase 2: Financial Dimensions** | Added `branch_id`, `warehouse_id`, `profit_center_id`, `partner_id` to `GLJournalLine`; created `ProfitCenter` model; wired dimensions through `reverse_entry`, `GLService.create_journal_entry`, `post_entry`, `create_manual_entry`, `post_or_fail` | ✅ SCHEMA COMPLETED | Migration `phase2_001_add_gl_dimensions_and_profit_centers` |
| **Phase 3: MWAC Data Model** | Created `ProductWarehouseCost` (active WAC per product/warehouse) and `ProductCostHistory` (immutable audit trail) models | ✅ SCHEMA COMPLETED | Migration `phase3_001_add_mwac_exchange_rate_treasury_models` |
| **Phase 6: Exchange Rate Framework** | Created `ExchangeRateRecord` model (locked rates per document, manual/API source tracking) | ✅ SCHEMA COMPLETED | Migration `phase3_001` |
| **Phase 8: Treasury** | Created `CashBox` model (cash/bank/gateway unified liquidity container with GL linkage) | ✅ SCHEMA COMPLETED | Migration `phase3_001` |
| **Feature Flags** | Added `ENABLE_MWAC`, `ENABLE_LANDED_COST_CAPITALIZATION`, `ENABLE_ONLINE_EXCHANGE_RATE_FALLBACK`, `ENABLE_ADVANCED_RECONCILIATION`, `ENABLE_LOCALIZATION_FRAMEWORK` to `config.py` | ✅ COMPLETED | `config.py` lines 187-205 |
| **Schema Drift Cleanup** | 5 idempotent migrations fixing constraints, indexes, nullable columns, and orphaned AI tables | ✅ COMPLETED | `phase3_002` through `phase3_006`; `flask db check` reports **No new upgrade operations detected** |
| **Dynamic GL Wiring** | `get_payment_debit_account` and `get_customer_credit_account` now attempt `resolve_gl_account` when `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL_MAPPING=True` before falling back to legacy hardcoded codes; `sale_service.py` refactored to use `get_customer_credit_account(branch_id, tenant_id)` | ✅ COMPLETED | `services/gl_service.py`, `services/sale_service.py` |
| **Database Sync** | All 6 new tables created; all dimension columns present; orphaned `ai_*` tables backed up and removed | ✅ COMPLETED | Verified via `flask db current` = `phase3_006` |

**Commit:** `dfdfac1` (Phase 1-8 schema), `935737a` (drift fixes), `a8d055e` (GL resolver wiring), `a48665b` (final drift + AI cleanup) — all pushed to `origin/main`.

## 13. Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Baseline Correction & Documentation Prep
*   **Goal:** Enforce unified mathematical rounding rules in system configuration.
*   **Files Affected:** `config.py` (add global rounding parameters).
*   **Accounting Impact:** Establishes 6-decimal internal precision and currency-specific journal rounding models.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Low (1-2 days).
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### Phase 1: Dynamic GL Mapping Foundation — **COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** Replace hardcoded account code strings (e.g. `'1130'`, `'1140'`) with dynamic concept resolutions.
*   **Files Affected:** `models/gl.py`, `services/gl_service.py`, `services/gl_posting.py`.
*   **Models Needed:** `GLAccountMapping` (mapping standard GL concepts to tenant chart accounts).
*   **Migrations Needed:** `create_gl_account_mappings_table`.
*   **Status:** All sub-phases 1E through 1L completed. See Section 12.6 for detailed completion notes.
*   **Feature Flag:** `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL_MAPPING` remains disabled by default until Phase 2+ dimensions are enforced.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **Actual: 2 Sprints**.
*   **Dependencies:** Phase 0.

### Phase 2: Financial Dimensions Enforcement — **SCHEMA COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** Enforce and validate dimension columns on journal entries and lines.
*   **Files Affected:** `models/gl.py`, `services/gl_service.py`, `services/gl_posting.py`.
*   **Models Added:** `ProfitCenter`; `GLJournalLine` extended with `branch_id`, `warehouse_id`, `profit_center_id`, `partner_id`.
*   **Migrations:** `phase2_001_add_gl_dimensions_and_profit_centers`.
*   **Status:** Schema and model wiring complete. Dimensions are propagated in `reverse_entry`, `create_journal_entry`, `post_entry`, `create_manual_entry`, and `post_or_fail`. Service-layer enforcement (mandatory dimension validation) is deferred until operational UI passes dimensions explicitly.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **Schema: DONE**.

### Phase 3: MWAC Data Model Design — **SCHEMA COMPLETED**
*   **Goal:** Deploy database schemas to store per-warehouse stock values.
*   **Files Affected:** `models/product_warehouse_cost.py`, `models/product_cost_history.py`.
*   **Models Added:** `ProductWarehouseCost` (active inventory valuation), `ProductCostHistory` (immutable audit trail).
*   **Migrations:** `phase3_001_add_mwac_exchange_rate_treasury_models`.
*   **Status:** Schema deployed. Transaction-flow recalculation logic (Phase 4) is the next dependency.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Low (3-4 days) — **Schema: DONE**.

### Phase 4: MWAC Transaction Flows — ✅ COMPLETED (June 5, 2026)
*   **Goal:** Hook operational purchases, sales, and warehouse receipts to average cost recalculations.
*   **Files Affected:** `services/stock_service.py`, `services/sale_service.py`, `services/purchase_service.py`.
*   **Services Affected:** `StockService`, `SaleService`, `PurchaseService`.
*   **Migrations Needed:** None.
*   **Accounting Impact:** Perpetual stock values update at true average costs on each receipt. COGS postings now use WAC instead of `SaleLine.cost_price`.
*   **Rollback Strategy:** `ENABLE_MWAC` flag (default: `True`).
*   **Evidence:**
    - `tools/seed_opening_wac.py`: seeded 38 products across active tenants from historical purchases.
    - `tools/qa/test_mwac_end_to_end.py`: E2E test PASS — purchase receipt updates WAC, sale COGS reads from WAC, audit trail created.
    - `StockService._update_wac_on_receipt()`: recalculates MWAC and appends `ProductCostHistory`.
    - `StockService.calculate_sale_cogs_and_deduct()`: computes COGS from `ProductWarehouseCost.average_cost`.
    - `config.py`: `ENABLE_MWAC=True` by default.
*   **Commits:** `929348f` (MWAC + exchange rate fixes).

### Phase 5: Landed Cost Capitalization — ✅ COMPLETED (June 5, 2026)
*   **Goal:** Capitalize transport, insurance, and duties directly into inventory value.
*   **Files Affected:** `models/purchase.py`, `services/purchase_service.py`, `services/stock_service.py`, `routes/purchases.py`, `templates/purchases/create.html`.
*   **Services Affected:** `PurchaseService`, `StockService`.
*   **Models Added:** `Purchase.freight`, `Purchase.insurance`, `Purchase.customs_duty`, `Purchase.other_landed_cost`, `PurchaseLine.landed_cost`.
*   **Migrations:** `phase5_001`.
*   **Status:** Schema deployed. Landed costs are proportionally allocated by line value to `PurchaseLine.landed_cost`, then included in `PurchaseLine.landed_unit_cost` which feeds MWAC via `StockService.process_purchase_lines()`. GL inventory debit and AP credit both include total landed cost. Purchase creation template updated with landed cost fields.
*   **Evidence:**
    - `test_landed_cost_end_to_end.py`: ALL LANDED COST TESTS PASSED (allocation, WAC inclusion, COGS, GL math).
    - `test_mwac_end_to_end.py`: ALL MWAC TESTS PASSED.
    - `gl_mapping_validation_dry_run.py`: 0 critical / 0 warning.
    - `gl_dynamic_posting_resolution_check.py`: ready true.
    - `py_compile`, Jinja parse: all pass.
    - `git diff --check`: clean.
    - **Bug fix:** `services/purchase_service.py:187` removed duplicate `+ total_landed` in AP calculation. `purchase.total_amount` already includes landed cost since `models/purchase.py` fix.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **DONE**.

### Phase 6: Exchange Rate Framework — ✅ COMPLETED (June 5, 2026)
*   **Goal:** Secure multi-currency documents using manual manager rates and online fallback tables.
*   **Files Affected:** `models/exchange_rate_record.py`, `services/exchange_rate_service.py`, `services/donation_gl_service.py`, `services/payment_service.py`, `services/purchase_service.py`, `services/return_service.py`, `services/sale_service.py`.
*   **Models Added:** `ExchangeRateRecord` (rate locking per document, manual/API source tracking).
*   **Migrations:** `phase3_001`.
*   **Status:** Schema deployed. All transaction types (Sale, Purchase, Payment, Receipt, Expense, Cheque, Donation) now call `ExchangeRateService.resolve_exchange_rate_for_transaction()` instead of legacy direct `exchange_rate` usage. POS fixed to store base price and convert per currency.
*   **Evidence:**
    - `gl_mapping_validation_dry_run.py`: 0 critical / 0 warning.
    - `accounting_audit.py`: all GL entries balanced.
    - `py_compile`, `node --check`, Jinja parse: all pass.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **DONE**.

### Phase 7: Reconciliation Reports — ✅ COMPLETED (June 6, 2026) — Post-Audit Fixes Applied
*   **Goal:** Deploy read-only reconciliation tools comparing physical stock to ledger assets.
*   **Files Affected:** `services/inventory_reconciliation_service.py`, `routes/reports.py`, `templates/reports/inventory_reconciliation.html`, `services/celery_tasks.py`.
*   **Services Affected:** `InventoryReconciliationService`, Celery scheduled task.
*   **Migrations Needed:** None.
*   **Accounting Impact:** Exposes stock ledger and account ledger variances. Read-only: never auto-corrects data.
*   **Features Delivered:**
    - Per-product/warehouse reconciliation: PWC vs stock_movements.
    - Warehouse-level summary: PWC vs GL inventory account (1140) fetched **once per warehouse** (no double-counting).
    - Dual-match status badges: qty match + value match.
    - Date range filtering wired end-to-end (`date_from` / `date_to` on stock movements and GL `entry_date`).
    - Warehouse filter wired end-to-end (selector in UI + service + export).
    - Excel/CSV export (`/inventory-reconciliation/export`) with branch security (`report_branch_scope_id` / `user_can_access_branch`).
    - Export carries all active screen filters (branch, warehouse, date range).
    - Scheduled Celery beat task (`daily-inventory-reconciliation`) for automated daily checks.
    - Menu links in sidebar and reports index.
*   **Audit Fixes (June 6, 2026):**
    - **FIX:** `_gl_inventory_balance` loop reassignment bug — filters were silently ignored because `for q in (debit_q, credit_q): q = q.filter(...)` mutated the loop variable only.
    - **FIX:** Removed per-product GL value to eliminate double-counting; GL comparison moved to warehouse-summary level only.
    - **FIX:** Export endpoint now enforces same branch-scope checks as display route.
    - **FIX:** Export URLs now propagate `warehouse_id`, `date_from`, `date_to`.
    - **FIX:** `build_warehouse_summary` computes `total_gl_value` from warehouse rows (no inflation).
    - **FIX:** Added `gl_untagged` flag when warehouse-filtered GL is 0 but aggregate GL is non-zero (legacy entries without warehouse_id).
*   **Evidence:**
    - `tools/qa/test_inventory_reconciliation.py`: ALL CHECKS PASSED (GL accuracy, per-product row structure, warehouse summary GL fields, date filter wiring, warehouse filter wiring, Celery beat_schedule, export route security, direct GL <= report GL).
    - `check_inventory.py`: All PWC records match movement net quantities.
    - `py_compile`, Jinja2 parse: all pass.
*   **Risks:** Performance lag on large tables → mitigated by indexed queries.
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Remove menu links from user dashboard.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Low (1 Sprint) — **DONE**.
*   **Dependencies:** Phase 6 ✅. Data cleanup (Option D) ✅.

### Phase 7.5: Security Hardening & Multi-Tenant Data Leak Prevention — **🔄 IN PROGRESS (June 6, 2026)**
*   **Goal:** Eliminate cross-tenant, cross-branch, and cross-role data leakage across all routes, services, and templates.
*   **Files Affected:** `routes/ai.py`, `routes/owner.py`, `routes/api.py`, `routes/payment_vault.py`, `routes/main.py`, `tools/qa/test_security_boundaries.py`.
*   **Models Used:** `Product`, `Customer`, `AuditLog`, `User`, `Branch`, `PaymentVault`, `Donation`, `Package`.
*   **Migrations Needed:** None.
*   **Vulnerabilities Discovered (Security Audit, June 6, 2026):**
    1. `routes/ai.py`: `Product.query.get_or_404(id)` and `Customer.query.get(id)` — any logged-in user can read/modify any product/customer from any tenant by ID.
    2. `routes/ai.py`: `Customer.query.filter_by(is_active=True).all()` — AI chat leaks ALL customers across ALL tenants.
    3. `routes/ai.py`: `Product.query.filter_by(is_active=True).limit(10).all()` — AI chat leaks products from all tenants.
    4. `routes/owner.py`: `AuditLog.query.count()` / `AuditLog.query.order_by(...).all()` — owner dashboard shows audit logs from ALL tenants.
    5. `routes/owner.py`: `User.query.filter_by(is_active=True, is_owner=False).count()` — user count crosses tenants.
    6. `routes/owner.py`: `Product.query.filter_by(is_active=True).count()` — product count crosses tenants when branch=None.
    7. `routes/owner.py`: `Branch.query.all()` — branch list crosses tenants.
    8. `routes/api.py`: `User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()` — username uniqueness check crosses tenants.
    9. `routes/api.py`: `_scoped_customer_query()` and `_scoped_supplier_query()` — no tenant_id filter.
    10. `routes/payment_vault.py`: `PaymentVault.query.first()` — global singleton, no tenant scope.
    11. `routes/payment_vault.py`: `Donation.query.filter_by(transaction_type=...)` — donations leak across tenants.
    12. `routes/payment_vault.py`: `Package.query.order_by(...).all()` — packages leak across tenants.
    13. `routes/main.py`: `Product.query.filter_by(is_active=True).count()` — dashboard product count crosses tenants when branch=None.
*   **Fixes Required:**
    1. **AI Routes:** Replace all bare `.get(id)` with `tenant_query(Model).filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()`.
    2. **AI Routes:** Add `tenant_id` filter to all `Customer.query` and `Product.query` operations.
    3. **Owner Dashboard:** Scope `AuditLog`, `User`, `Product`, `Branch` queries by `tenant_id`.
    4. **API Routes:** Add `tenant_id` filter to `_scoped_customer_query()` and `_scoped_supplier_query()`.
    5. **API Routes:** Scope `User.query` by `tenant_id` in username check.
    6. **Payment Vault:** Scope `PaymentVault`, `Donation`, `Package` by `tenant_id`.
    7. **Main Dashboard:** Scope `Product` count by `tenant_id` when `branch_id` is None.
*   **QA Acceptance Criteria:**
    - `tools/qa/test_security_boundaries.py` ALL CHECKS PASSED.
    - Zero unscoped `Model.query.get()`, `Model.query.all()`, `Model.query.count()` in routes directory.
    - No raw model queries in Jinja2 templates.
*   **Status:** Vulnerabilities discovered; fixes in progress.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (3-4 days) — **IN PROGRESS**.
*   **Dependencies:** Phase 7 ✅.

### Phase 8: Treasury & Cash Position Reporting — **PLAN LOCKED (June 6, 2026) — Implementation ⏳ PENDING Phase 7.5**
*   **Goal:** Multi-branch bank, cashier, and post-dated cheque position tracking with GL-backed accuracy.
*   **Files Affected:** `services/treasury_service.py`, `routes/reports.py`, `templates/reports/treasury.html`, `templates/reports/index.html`, `templates/base.html`.
*   **Models Used:** `CashBox`, `GLAccount` (`liquidity_kind`), `Cheque`, `BankReconciliation`, `Branch`.
*   **Migrations Needed:** None (schema deployed in `phase3_001`).
*   **Design Decisions (post-audit):**
    - `CashBox` table may be empty because `system_init.py` seeds GL accounts but does **not** auto-create `CashBox` rows. The service will use `CashBox` as primary source when populated; when empty, it will derive liquidity accounts from `GLAccount` where `liquidity_kind IN ('cash','bank','gateway','card','in_transit')` and compute balances via `GLAccount.get_balance()`.
    - This avoids a data-seeding dependency and makes the dashboard useful immediately on existing GL data.
    - `GLAccount.get_balance()` is used for GL-side balances; `CashBox.current_balance` is used only when explicit cash-box records exist.
    - No double-counting: each GL account appears exactly once; `CashBox` + `GLAccount` fallback are mutually exclusive per tenant.
*   **Features to Deliver:**
    1. **Cash Position Summary Cards:** total cash, total bank, total under-collection, total gateways, grand total AED.
    2. **Liquidity Accounts Table:** per-account breakdown (code, name, type, GL balance, currency, branch).
    3. **Cheque Maturity Dashboard:**
       - Incoming cheques: pending/deposited/under_collection, grouped by maturity bucket (overdue, 0-7 days, 8-30 days, 31+ days).
       - Outgoing cheques: same grouping.
       - Per-cheque row: number, bank, amount AED, due date, days remaining, status badge.
    4. **Bank Reconciliation Status:** latest 5 reconciliations per bank account with balance-diff indicator.
    5. **Branch Filter:** wired end-to-end via `report_branch_scope_id()`; export carries same filters.
    6. **Export:** Excel/CSV export of liquidity accounts + cheque maturity list.
*   **Security Requirements:**
    - Route applies `report_branch_scope_id()` + `user_can_access_branch()` (same pattern as Phase 7 export fix).
    - Export endpoint applies identical branch-scope validation.
*   **QA Acceptance Criteria:**
    - `test_treasury.py` validates: (a) no double-counting across liquidity accounts, (b) branch filter actually restricts rows, (c) cheque date buckets are mathematically correct, (d) export route includes security checks, (e) GL balances are non-negative for asset accounts or correctly signed.
*   **Status:** Plan locked. Implementation in progress.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **Schema: DONE, Service: IN PROGRESS**.

### Phase 9: Global Localization Engine — **PLAN LOCKED (June 6, 2026) — Pending Phase 8**
*   **Goal:** Country-specific compliance engines for Palestine, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Hot-swappable per-tenant without code redeploy.
*   **Files Affected:** `utils/localization/`, `services/tax_service.py` (new), `routes/reports.py`, `models/tenant.py`.
*   **Models Used:** `Tenant` (`vat_country`, `enable_tax`, `default_tax_rate`), `GLAccount`, `GLJournalLine`.
*   **Migrations Needed:** None (tenant-level fields already exist: `vat_country`, `enable_tax`, `default_tax_rate`).
*   **Design Decisions (post-audit):**
    - `utils/tax_settings.py` already has `VAT_RATES_BY_COUNTRY` (AE=5%, IL=17%, PS=16%). This is the foundation.
    - Localization will NOT be hardcoded in `sale_service.py` / `purchase_service.py`. Instead, a `LocalizationEngine` class dispatches to country-specific strategy objects.
    - Palestine strategy: 16% VAT, multi-currency (ILS/JOD/USD), PMA reporting format, WPS (Wage Protection System) export.
    - UAE strategy: 5% VAT, AED-only for tax reporting, FTA (Federal Tax Authority) export format.
    - KSA strategy: 15% VAT (configurable), Simplified Invoice (Fatoorah) QR code generation.
    - Each strategy implements: `calculate_tax()`, `format_tax_return()`, `generate_einvoice()`, `get_wps_format()`.
    - Strategy selection: `Tenant.vat_country` → strategy registry lookup. Unknown country → `NullStrategy` (tax=0, no compliance reports).
*   **Features to Deliver:**
    1. **Localization Engine Framework:** `utils/localization/engine.py` with base `LocalizationStrategy` and country-specific subclasses.
    2. **Tax Calculation Service (`services/tax_service.py`):**
       - `TaxService.calculate_sale_tax(sale, country)` → returns tax lines per strategy.
       - `TaxService.calculate_purchase_tax(purchase, country)` → input VAT recovery.
    3. **VAT Return Report (`routes/reports.py` new route):**
       - `/vat-return` per country format: output VAT, input VAT, net payable.
       - Country-specific date periods (monthly/quarterly) driven by strategy.
    4. **E-Invoicing Format (`services/einvoice_service.py`):**
       - Palestine: XML export compatible with Ministry of Finance.
       - UAE: FTA-compliant XML + QR code generation.
       - KSA: ZATCA Phase 2 (simplified invoice XML + QR base64).
    5. **WPS Export (Palestine only):**
       - `/wps-export` route → SIF (Salary Information File) format.
       - Includes employee ID, IBAN, net salary, bank code.
    6. **Tenant Settings UI:**
       - Dropdown `vat_country` in tenant settings.
       - Auto-populate `default_tax_rate` from `VAT_RATES_BY_COUNTRY`.
       - Toggle `enable_tax` with audit log.
*   **Security Requirements:**
    - Tax return data is scoped by `tenant_id` (no cross-tenant leak).
    - WPS export contains PII — route requires `manage_payroll` permission.
    - E-invoice generation is read-only but must be signed by authorized user.
*   **QA Acceptance Criteria:**
    - `test_localization.py` validates: (a) each country strategy returns correct tax rate, (b) `NullStrategy` returns zero tax for unsupported country, (c) VAT return total equals sum of sale tax lines minus purchase tax lines, (d) WPS file format has correct SIF headers, (e) e-invoice QR code is decodable and contains correct VAT amount.
    - `py_compile`, Jinja2 parse pass.
*   **Status:** Plan locked. Blocked on Phase 8 completion.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Medium (1 Sprint) — **Blocked until Phase 8 ✅**.

### Phase 10: Testing, Validation, and Rollout — **PLAN LOCKED (June 6, 2026) — Pending Phase 9**
*   **Goal:** Run full end-to-end regression test suite, seed historical records, and deploy to production with feature flags.
*   **Files Affected:** `tools/qa/` (all test scripts), `docs/ERP_ACCOUNTING_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md`, `config.py` (feature flags).
*   **Design Decisions (post-audit):**
    - No "big bang" deployment. Each phase is gated by a feature flag: `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL`, `ENABLE_MWAC`, `ENABLE_LANDED_COST`, `ENABLE_EXCHANGE_RATE_LOCK`, `ENABLE_RECONCILIATION`, `ENABLE_TREASURY`, `ENABLE_LOCALIZATION`.
    - Rollout order: internal tenant → beta tenant → all tenants.
    - Historical seeding is manual (accountant supervised), not automated.
    - Load testing uses `tools/qa/load_test.py` with parameterized tenant size (small=1K records, medium=50K, large=500K).
*   **Features to Deliver:**
    1. **End-to-End Regression Suite (`tools/qa/test_full_regression.py`):**
       - Purchase receipt → WAC recalculation → Sale → COGS posting → GL balance → Inventory reconciliation → Treasury cash position.
       - Asserts zero variance at every handoff.
    2. **Load Testing (`tools/qa/load_test.py`):**
       - 100 concurrent sale invoices.
       - 1,000 concurrent purchase receipts.
       - GL balance query latency < 500ms for 500K journal lines.
    3. **Historical Data Seeding Playbook (`docs/HISTORICAL_SEEDING_PLAYBOOK.md`):**
       - Step-by-step guide for accountant to seed opening balances.
       - PWC opening balance via `tools/qa/backfill_pwc_opening_balances.py`.
       - GL opening balance via manual journal entry (accountant supervised).
       - Cheque opening balance via bulk import CSV.
    4. **Feature Flag Matrix (`config.py` or tenant settings):**
       - Each phase has an `ENABLE_*` flag.
       - Flags are per-tenant, not global.
       - Rollout dashboard showing which tenant has which flag enabled.
    5. **Production Deployment Checklist (`docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`):**
       - Database backup verification.
       - Migration dry-run.
       - Celery worker health check.
       - Redis cache flush plan.
       - Rollback procedure (revert flags + DB restore point).
    6. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
       - Celery task success rate > 99%.
       - GL out-of-balance alert (automatic email to admin if any entry is unbalanced).
       - Inventory reconciliation mismatch alert (daily email if qty_diff != 0).
*   **QA Acceptance Criteria:**
    - `test_full_regression.py` passes with zero variance across all handoffs.
    - Load test: 95th percentile response time < 2s for all report queries.
    - Feature flag matrix is documented and auditable.
    - Rollback procedure is tested on a staging environment (not production).
    - All previous phase QA tests (`test_inventory_reconciliation.py`, `test_treasury.py`, `test_localization.py`) still pass.
*   **Status:** Plan locked. Blocked on Phase 9 completion.
*   **Estimated Complexity:** Low (1-2 Sprints) — **Blocked until Phase 9 ✅**.

### Data Cleanup — ✅ COMPLETED (June 5, 2026)

| Issue | Action | Count | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Orphaned stock movements | Deleted (no parent doc) | 56 (tenants 2 + 8) | ✅ Done |
| Orphaned GL entries | Deleted (missing parent) | 9 | ✅ Done |
| ILS cheque FX mismatch | Normalized `exchange_rate` | 20 (tenant 2) | ✅ Done |
| Negative PWC quantities | Zeroed out | 3 records | ✅ Done |
| GL coverage per ref type | Verified all covered | 5 types | ✅ OK |
| PWC vs movement mismatch | Opening balance backfill | 37 records | ✅ Done (36 opening_balance movements + 1 manual fix) |

All PWC quantities now match `SUM(stock_movements.quantity)` exactly.

---

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### 1. Phase 7.5: Security Hardening & Data Leak Prevention (3-4 days) — ACTIVE
**Step 7.5.1 — Fix AI Routes (`routes/ai.py`)**
- Replace `Product.query.get_or_404(id)` with `tenant_query(Product).filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()`.
- Replace `Customer.query.get(id)` with `tenant_query(Customer).filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()`.
- Add `tenant_id` filter to ALL `Customer.query` and `Product.query` operations in AI chat handlers.

**Step 7.5.2 — Fix Owner Dashboard (`routes/owner.py`)**
- Scope `AuditLog.query` by `tenant_id` in count/all/order_by operations.
- Scope `User.query` by `tenant_id` in user count and list operations.
- Scope `Product.query` by `tenant_id` in product count.
- Scope `Branch.query` by `tenant_id` in branch list.

**Step 7.5.3 — Fix API Routes (`routes/api.py`)**
- Add `tenant_id` filter to `_scoped_customer_query()` and `_scoped_supplier_query()`.
- Scope `User.query` by `tenant_id` in username uniqueness check.

**Step 7.5.4 — Fix Payment Vault (`routes/payment_vault.py`)**
- Scope `PaymentVault.query` by `tenant_id` (or document if it's intentionally global).
- Scope `Donation.query` by `tenant_id`.
- Scope `Package.query` by `tenant_id`.

**Step 7.5.5 — Fix Main Dashboard (`routes/main.py`)**
- Scope `Product.query.filter_by(is_active=True).count()` by `tenant_id` when `branch_id` is None.

**Step 7.5.6 — QA Gate**
- Run `tools/qa/test_security_boundaries.py` until ALL CHECKS PASSED.
- **Blueprint Phase 7.5 marked COMPLETED only after test passes.**

#### 2. Phase 8: Treasury Service Execution (1 Sprint) — Detailed Plan
**Step 8.1 — Service Layer (`services/treasury_service.py`)**
- `TreasuryService.get_liquidity_position(tenant_id, branch_id)`:
  - Primary source: `CashBox` rows for tenant/branch.
  - Fallback (if CashBox empty): `GLAccount` with `liquidity_kind IN ('cash','bank','gateway','card','in_transit')`.
  - Balance: `CashBox.current_balance` when available; otherwise `GLAccount.get_balance()`.
  - Group by `box_type`/`liquidity_kind` into cash, bank, under_collection, gateway, digital_wallet.
- `TreasuryService.get_cheque_maturity(tenant_id, branch_id, buckets=(0,7,30))`:
  - Query `Cheque` for `cheque_type='incoming'/'outgoing'`, `status IN ('pending','deposited','under_collection')`.
  - Bucket by `days_until_due`: overdue, 0-7 days, 8-30 days, 31+ days.
  - Sum `amount_aed` per bucket.
- `TreasuryService.get_bank_reconciliation_status(tenant_id, branch_id, limit=5)`:
  - Query `BankReconciliation` ordered by `created_at DESC`.
  - Include `closing_balance_per_books`, `closing_balance_per_bank`, `difference`, `status`.
- `TreasuryService.build_dashboard(tenant_id, branch_id)`:
  - Aggregates all data into a single report dict.

**Step 8.2 — Route Layer (`routes/reports.py`)**
- `GET /treasury`: branch security (`report_branch_scope_id` + `user_can_access_branch`), tenant scope, render `treasury.html`.
- `GET /treasury/export`: same security, Excel/CSV export with `format` param.

**Step 8.3 — UI Layer (`templates/reports/treasury.html`)**
- Summary cards: total cash, total bank, total under-collection, total gateways, grand total.
- Branch filter dropdown (same pattern as inventory reconciliation).
- Liquidity accounts table: code, name, type, balance AED, currency.
- Cheque maturity tables: incoming + outgoing, 4 buckets each, with per-cheque detail rows.
- Bank reconciliation mini-table: last 5 recs with status badge.
- Export buttons (Excel/CSV) carrying current branch filter.

**Step 8.4 — Navigation**
- Add link in `templates/reports/index.html` under Financial Reports.
- Add link in `templates/base.html` sidebar under Reports menu.

**Step 8.5 — QA Gate**
- `tools/qa/test_treasury.py` with assertions:
  - (a) `get_liquidity_position` total equals sum of rows (no double-count).
  - (b) Fake branch_id returns zero rows (branch filter enforced).
  - (c) Cheque bucket boundaries are inclusive and non-overlapping.
  - (d) Export route source contains `report_branch_scope_id` and `user_can_access_branch`.
  - (e) `py_compile` + Jinja2 parse pass.
- **Blueprint marked COMPLETED only after ALL CHECKS PASSED.**

#### 2. Phase 9: Global Localization Engine (1 Sprint) — Detailed Plan
**Step 9.1 — Engine Framework (`utils/localization/`)**
- `utils/localization/engine.py`: `LocalizationStrategy` base class with abstract methods `calculate_tax()`, `format_tax_return()`, `generate_einvoice()`, `get_wps_format()`.
- `utils/localization/palestine.py`: `PalestineStrategy` — 16% VAT, multi-currency (ILS/JOD/USD), PMA XML, WPS SIF.
- `utils/localization/uae.py`: `UAEStrategy` — 5% VAT, AED-only, FTA XML.
- `utils/localization/ksa.py`: `KSAStrategy` — 15% VAT, ZATCA Phase 2 QR.
- `utils/localization/null.py`: `NullStrategy` — zero tax, empty reports for unsupported countries.
- `utils/localization/registry.py`: `get_strategy(country_code)` mapping.

**Step 9.2 — Tax Service (`services/tax_service.py`)**
- `TaxService.calculate_sale_tax(sale)` → dispatches to strategy based on `Tenant.vat_country`.
- `TaxService.calculate_purchase_tax(purchase)` → input VAT recovery per strategy.
- `TaxService.get_vat_return(date_from, date_to)` → output VAT minus input VAT per strategy format.

**Step 9.3 — VAT Return Route (`routes/reports.py`)**
- `GET /vat-return`: country-specific format, branch security, tenant scope.
- `GET /vat-return/export`: Excel/CSV per strategy column layout.

**Step 9.4 — E-Invoice Service (`services/einvoice_service.py`)**
- `EInvoiceService.generate(sale, country)` → XML + QR per strategy.
- Palestine: Ministry of Finance XML schema.
- UAE: FTA XML + TLV-encoded QR.
- KSA: ZATCA simplified invoice XML + base64 QR.

**Step 9.5 — WPS Export (Palestine only, `routes/reports.py`)**
- `GET /wps-export`: requires `manage_payroll` permission.
- SIF format: employee ID, IBAN, net salary, bank code.

**Step 9.6 — Tenant Settings UI**
- Add `vat_country` dropdown in tenant admin settings.
- Auto-populate `default_tax_rate` from `VAT_RATES_BY_COUNTRY`.
- Audit log on `enable_tax` toggle.

**Step 9.7 — QA Gate**
- `tools/qa/test_localization.py`: (a) each strategy returns correct rate, (b) `NullStrategy` returns zero, (c) VAT return total equals sale tax minus purchase tax, (d) WPS SIF headers correct, (e) QR decodable with correct VAT amount.
- **Blueprint marked COMPLETED only after ALL CHECKS PASSED.**

#### 3. Phase 10: Final Testing & Rollout (1-2 Sprints) — Detailed Plan
**Step 10.1 — End-to-End Regression Suite (`tools/qa/test_full_regression.py`)**
- Chain: Purchase receipt → WAC recalc → Sale → COGS posting → GL balance → Inventory reconciliation → Treasury cash position.
- Assert zero variance at every handoff.
- Run against staging database with real tenant data (anonymized).

**Step 10.2 — Load Testing (`tools/qa/load_test.py`)**
- 100 concurrent sale invoices (< 3s p95).
- 1,000 concurrent purchase receipts (< 5s p95).
- GL balance query < 500ms for 500K journal lines.
- Report query < 2s p95 for all reconciliation and treasury reports.

**Step 10.3 — Historical Seeding Playbook (`docs/HISTORICAL_SEEDING_PLAYBOOK.md`)**
- Step-by-step guide for accountant.
- PWC opening balance: `tools/qa/backfill_pwc_opening_balances.py`.
- GL opening balance: manual journal entry (accountant supervised, signed off).
- Cheque opening balance: bulk CSV import with validation.
- Exchange rate history: `tools/qa/seed_exchange_rates.py`.

**Step 10.4 — Feature Flag Matrix**
- Per-tenant flags in `config.py` or `Tenant.settings`: `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL`, `ENABLE_MWAC`, `ENABLE_LANDED_COST`, `ENABLE_EXCHANGE_RATE_LOCK`, `ENABLE_RECONCILIATION`, `ENABLE_TREASURY`, `ENABLE_LOCALIZATION`.
- Rollout dashboard: which tenant has which flag.
- Rollout order: internal tenant → beta tenant → all tenants.

**Step 10.5 — Production Deployment Checklist (`docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`)**
- Database backup verification (test restore on separate server).
- Migration dry-run (`flask db upgrade --sql` reviewed).
- Celery worker health check (queue depth, worker count).
- Redis cache flush plan (safe eviction, no data loss).
- Rollback procedure: revert flags + DB restore point (tested on staging).

**Step 10.6 — Post-Deployment Monitoring**
- Celery task success rate > 99% (alert if < 95%).
- GL out-of-balance alert (daily check, email admin if unbalanced entries exist).
- Inventory reconciliation mismatch alert (daily email if `qty_diff != 0` or `value_diff != 0`).
- Treasury liquidity alert (weekly email if any account balance goes negative unexpectedly).

**Step 10.7 — QA Gate**
- `test_full_regression.py` passes with zero variance.
- Load test meets all latency targets.
- Rollback procedure tested on staging (simulate failure, verify restore).
- All previous phase QA tests still pass (no regression).
- **Blueprint marked COMPLETED only after ALL CHECKS PASSED.**

### Completed Option Details (For Reference)

**Option A — Dynamic GL Mapping (Phase 1):** `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL_MAPPING=True`. All critical concepts resolve dynamically. Legacy fallback with validation guards.

**Option B — MWAC Transaction Flows (Phase 4):** `ENABLE_MWAC=True`. Purchase receipts trigger WAC recalc. Sale COGS reads from `ProductWarehouseCost.average_cost`. 38 products seeded.

**Option C — Landed Cost Capitalization (Phase 5):** `Purchase` fields `freight/insurance/customs_duty/other_landed_cost`. Proportional allocation to `PurchaseLine.landed_cost`. WAC and GL include landed costs.

**Option D — Historical Data Cleanup:** Orphaned movements deleted (101 total), orphaned GL entries deleted (84 total), cheque FX normalized, GL coverage verified, `check_inventory.py` rewritten, 37 PWC mismatches backfilled with `opening_balance` stock movements, AP double-counting bug fixed in `purchase_service.py`.

## 15. Technical Approval Gates

To protect the production database, the team must pass five explicit gates:
1.  **Gate 1 (DB Schema):** Before running migrations creating `product_warehouse_costs` or adding line-item dimensions.
2.  **Gate 2 (GL Postings):** Before swapping hardcoded accounts in code with dynamic mapping lookups.
3.  **Gate 3 (Seeding Verification):** Before running the migration scripts to calculate opening MWAC costs for active products.
4.  **Gate 4 (UAT Pass):** Accountant signature verifying multi-currency conversion reports and tax return schedules.
5.  **Gate 5 (Feature Flag Rollout):** Phased release to specific tenants.

---

## 16. Testing Strategy
Exhaustive test scenarios must validate:
1.  **MWAC Calculation:** Averages recalculate on receipt; sales do not alter unit cost.
2.  **Conversion Accuracy:** Converting foreign invoices without rounding variance.
3.  **Dimension Integrity:** Postings abort if `warehouse_id` or `branch_id` are missing on operational rows.
4.  **Period Protection:** Modifications to closed periods raise `ClosedPeriodError`.
5.  **Rounding Integrity:** Banker's rounding ensures debits match credits exactly for JOD/AED currencies.

---

## 17. Feature Flags
All new logic paths are shielded behind:
*   `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_GL_MAPPING`
*   `ENABLE_MWAC`
*   `ENABLE_LANDED_COST_CAPITALIZATION`
*   `ENABLE_ONLINE_EXCHANGE_RATE_FALLBACK`
*   `ENABLE_ADVANCED_RECONCILIATION`
*   `ENABLE_LOCALIZATION_FRAMEWORK`

---

## 18. Migration Safety & Data Integrity Rules
*   **Abort on Variance:** If stock quantities or ledger values show drift exceeding limits during data migration, the process aborts.
*   **No Blind Backfills:** Existing tables are backfilled dynamically, validating the user/branch trail of records.
*   **Historical Immutability:** Closed-period entries are never modified. Corrections are posted in open periods via standard reversal entries.

---

## 19. Open Owner Decisions
1.  **Opening Balances Baseline:** Agreement on initial seed values for existing stock averages.
2.  **Landed Cost Manual Allocation Limits:** Thresholds and permissions to deviate from the "By Value" default allocation.
3.  **Unlinked Sales Return Limits:** Manager override limits for manual valuation overrides of unlinked returns.
4.  **Treasury Cash Box Limits:** Daily cash drawer caps before triggering cash deposits to central bank registers.
## Frontend / Admin UI Requirements

No frontend or admin UI changes are required for Phase 1E or Phase 1F. Phase 1E is schema/model foundation only, and Phase 1F is read-only validation/dry-run readiness reporting only.

Future phases require admin UI support for the following areas:

1. **Dynamic GL Mapping Admin UI**
   - Manage concept-to-account mappings.
   - Validate mappings.
   - Show missing and invalid mappings.
   - Apply a default mapping template.
   - Support tenant-level mappings first.
   - Add future branch override support.

2. **Tenant Onboarding Accounting Setup UI**
   - Create or select a chart of accounts.
   - Generate default GL mappings.
   - Run GL mapping validation.
   - Block accounting activation if required mappings are missing.

3. **Exchange Rate Management UI**
   - Allow manager manual exchange rate entry.
   - Show online fallback availability/indicator.
   - Store the selected rate on each document.
   - Show rate source: manual or online.
   - Prevent recalculation of historical documents.

4. **WAC / Inventory Valuation UI**
   - Product warehouse cost view.
   - MWAC audit history.
   - Inventory valuation by warehouse.
   - Stock-to-GL reconciliation report.

5. **Landed Cost Allocation UI**
   - Allocate freight, customs, insurance, and clearance costs.
   - Default allocation by value.
   - Future allocation methods: quantity, weight, volume, and manual allocation.

6. **Treasury and Cash Position UI**
   - Cash boxes.
   - Bank accounts.
   - Cheques under collection.
   - Payment gateways.
   - Cash position report.

## Appendix A: Reverse Engineering & Audit History

### A.1 Audit Timeline

| Phase | Scope | Key Outcome | Date |
|-------|-------|-------------|------|
| Phase 1 | Global Discovery & System Mapping | Full system map; multi-tenant isolation gaps identified | June 3, 2026 |
| Phase 2 | Accounting & Financial Integrity Deep Dive | Hardcoded GL codes and manual balance accumulators flagged | June 3, 2026 |
| Phase 3 | Inventory, Costing, and COGS Deep Dive | Last Purchase Cost confirmed; `ON DELETE CASCADE` on inventory audit trails identified | June 3, 2026 |
| Phase 4 | Inventory Valuation Decision | Recommended migration to **Weighted Average Cost** to eliminate Balance Sheet volatility | June 3, 2026 |

### A.2 Original Critical Findings (All Resolved)

| Risk Level | Area | Original Finding | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | Audit Trail | `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `StockMovement` wipes audit history if product deleted | **Fixed in Batch 2** (`RESTRICT` enforced) |
| **HIGH** | Security | Missing `tenant_id` in `advanced_accounting` models leads to cross-tenant data visibility | **Fixed in Batch 1** (tenant scoping added) |
| **HIGH** | Accuracy | Last Purchase Cost causes "valuation jumps" and Ledger-Stock drift | **Planned for Phase 3-4** (MWAC migration) |
| **MEDIUM** | Integrity | Manual balance accumulators for Customers/Suppliers prone to sync issues | **Ongoing monitoring** |
| **MEDIUM** | Integrity | Hardcoded GL account codes in services bypass tenant customization | **Fixed in Phase 1** (Dynamic GL Mapping deployed) |

### A.3 System Architecture Summary
- **Framework:** Flask (Python) with service-oriented business logic.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Multitenancy:** Shared-database, row-level isolation via `tenant_id`.
- **Localization:** Full Arabic (AR) and English (EN) support.
- **Core Modules:** Sales, Inventory (GL-integrated), Purchases, Payments, AI Analytics.

## Appendix B: Pre-Implementation Verification & Findings Validation

### B.1 CRITICAL: Audit Trail Vulnerability (ORM-Level Cascade)
- **Database Level:** Physical PostgreSQL schema defaulted to `NO ACTION` (not explicit `CASCADE`).
- **ORM Level:** SQLAlchemy `Product.stock_movements` had `cascade='all, delete-orphan'`.
- **Confirmed Behavior:** `db.session.delete(product)` would auto-delete all movement records.
- **Status:** RESOLVED in Batch 2.

### B.2 HIGH: Multi-Tenancy Data Leakage (Missing Scoping)
- **Confirmed Gap:** `advanced_expenses`, `customs_taxes`, `tax_calculation_rules` lacked `tenant_id`.
- **Security Risk:** Global visibility in a multi-tenant ERP.
- **Status:** RESOLVED in Batch 1.

### B.3 HIGH: Inventory Valuation Inconsistency (Costing Drift)
- **Confirmed Drift:** System uses global `Product.cost_price` but tracks historical accounting in `GLAccount` (1140).
- **Evidence:** `runtime_core/accounting_repair.py` calculates `inventory_diff = estimated_inventory - gl_inventory`.
- **Remediation:** Migrating to MWAC will stop drift at the source.
- **Status:** PLANNED for Phase 3-4.

### B.4 HIGH: Financial Document Vulnerability
- **Confirmed:** `Sale` → `SaleLine`, `Purchase` → `PurchaseLine`, `GLJournalEntry` → `GLJournalLine` lacked `RESTRICT`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED in Batch 3.
